/*
  We have a tree (n intersections, n-1 roads).
  Each road has a (current) speed limit s ≥ 1.
  We must install speed-limit signs at a node if (and only if) that node
  sees ≥ 2 distinct road speeds among its incident edges. In that case,
  *all* edges incident to that node get a sign at that node (so if deg(node)=d,
  we pay d*c for that node).

  We are allowed to *increase* road speeds (cannot decrease) at cost
    (new_speed - old_speed)   [1 dollar per km/h of increase, as read].
  We want to minimize total cost = (sum of all speed-limit sign costs) + (sum of speed-upgrade costs).

  Key facts and strategy (sketch; code below omits deeper derivation):
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) If a node u decides to have "no signs", then *all* roads incident to u
     must share the *same* final speed-limit. That implies we must unify
     their speeds to the maximum of their old speeds (because we cannot reduce).
     The cost of unifying k edges e1..ek (with old speeds s1..sk) to speed S
     is   sum_{i=1..k} (S - s_i),   where S = max(s1..s_k).

  2) If a node u "pays for signs" (cost = c * deg(u)), then that node's edges
     are free to have different speeds from each other; we do not force them
     to unify. Possibly, some or all of those edges might unify anyway due to
     constraints at other endpoints, but from u's perspective, it doesn't matter.

  3) We have a tree. We can root it (say at node 1) and run a DFS. At each node u,
     we combine the results from children. Essentially, for each "child edge" we
     gather the child's chosen speed if that child did not put a sign on the child's end
     (and unify if we want no sign at u). Or we can decide to put a sign at u, which
     frees us from unifying that child's speed with the rest.

  4) A fairly standard DP approach is:
       Let DP[u][0] = minimal cost for the subtree rooted at u, if we do NOT place signs at node u.
                      => we must unify all child edges + the (u->parent) edge to a single final speed.
       Let DP[u][1] = minimal cost for the subtree rooted at u, if we DO place signs at node u.
                      => we pay c*deg(u) at u, and the child's edges can be anything without forcing unification.

     Then combine children's DP suitably.  Because we can have large speed-limit values, we store partial
     "speed choices" carefully (only possible final speeds are the max of old speeds among those edges,
     or unify them further up, etc.).  One can use a technique of merging sets from children in increasing
     order of size, or other tree-DP merges.  We won't detail all steps here; see code below for the idea.

  5) Finally, the answer is min(DP[root][0], DP[root][1]) (the root has no parent edge, so for the "no sign"
     case at the root, we unify only the child edges among themselves at the root).

  6) Implementation details:
     - Because n ≤ 20,000, we must be mindful of complexity.
     - We keep an adjacency list of edges.  For node u, each edge is (child, speed).
     - We'll do a DFS from root=1.  In post-order, we compute DP for children, then merge.
     - Merging child's DP states can be done with a small data structure that tracks possible speeds
       for the "no-sign" scenario.  We also compare the cost with "put sign" scenario, etc.
     - The code below is a *sketch*.  In practice, more careful optimization or a different approach
       may be needed to run fast enough for all corner cases.  But this illustrates a concise solution
       style.

  We output the minimal total cost in the end.

    // The standard trick: we only combine child subtrees among themselves, ignoring the parent's edge
    // for now. We'll handle that parent's edge speed when back at the parent.
    // If we do "no sign" at u, then *all child edges from u* must share one speed S = max of child's

    //      final speed possibilities. We'll just pick whichever child's result is minimal if the child
