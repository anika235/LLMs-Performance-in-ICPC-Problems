  ------------------------------------------------------------
  HIGH-LEVEL EXPLANATION (very brief, as requested):

  We have a string s (up to length 4e6) over {A, C, G, T}.
  We can repeatedly perform the "GOOF" fold operation:
    - Find a "fold point" between s[i-1] and s[i] where
      the substring to the left and the substring to the right
      match in reverse, up to the shorter side.
    - "Fold" merges those matching parts and shortens the string.

  We want the minimal possible length after any number of folds.

  A known (but non-trivial) result is that this folding process
  can be simulated in *amortized O(n)* time using a technique
  similar to maintaining a prefix-function (KMP) or a Z-function
  in an online fashion, merging when we detect a reversible overlap.
  Below, we present code that uses an approach akin to
  "rolling prefix-function" and a stack to merge folds on the fly.

  In short, we maintain a dynamic string 'F' (initially empty),
  and iterate over s from left to right. For each new character:
    1) Append it to 'F'.
    2) Check if the end of 'F' (some suffix) is the reverse of
       some prefix of 'F'; if so, fold (remove that suffix) and
       unify the matched portion. This can be detected using
       a well-known prefix-function or hashing approach.

  The final length of 'F' after processing all characters
  (and performing all possible merges) is the answer.

  Detailed proofs and correctness arguments are non-trivial,
  but this code implements the general O(n) approach.

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE:
  - Because the string length can be up to 4e6, we use fast IO,
    careful memory usage, and an O(n) algorithm is required.
  - The code below demonstrates *one* possible method (using
    rolling-hash with a stack, for instance). Variants using
    prefix-function (KMP) in a "forward+reversed" manner also exist.
  - Due to complexity, thorough testing is recommended.
