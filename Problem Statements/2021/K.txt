Problem K
Take On Meme
Time limit: 4 seconds

Your ad agency uses a tournament to find the ultimate viral meme. Each round involves voting among k memes to create a new meme. The process continues until one meme remains, calculated based on the votes. Determine the largest possible quality for the final meme.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 104), the number of nodes in the tournament tree. Each of the next n lines describes a node. A node with k children lists k integers representing the children. A leaf node specifies two integers x and y, representing the meme's coordinates.

Output

Output the largest possible quality for the champion meme at node 1.
