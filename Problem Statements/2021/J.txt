Problem J
Splitstream
Time limit: 3 seconds

A splitstream system is an acyclic network of nodes that processes sequences of numbers. Nodes can either split a sequence into two alternating outputs or merge two sequences into one alternating output. Queries involve determining the kth number in the sequence at a specific output.

Input

The first line contains three integers m, n, and q, where m (1 ≤ m ≤ 109) is the length of the input sequence, n (1 ≤ n ≤ 104) is the number of nodes, and q (1 ≤ q ≤ 103) is the number of queries.

The next n lines describe the network. A split node has the format `S x y z`, where x is the input, y and z are the outputs. A merge node has the format `M x y z`, where x and y are inputs and z is the output.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers x and k, representing a query for the kth number in the sequence at output x.

Output

For each query, output the kth number in the sequence, or "none" if the index is out of bounds.
