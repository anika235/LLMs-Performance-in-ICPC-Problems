Problem H
Prehistoric Programs
Time limit: 6 seconds

Archaeologists have discovered clay tablets with symbols that describe nested structures resembling opening and closing parentheses. Taken together, these tablets form a program or script. Your task is to arrange them in a sequence so that the resulting work has a properly nested parenthesis structure.

A properly nested structure is either:
- (), or
- (A), where A is a properly nested structure, or
- AB, where A and B are properly nested structures.

Input

The first line of input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106), the number of tablets. Each of the remaining n lines describes a tablet, containing a non-empty string of opening and closing parentheses. The strings are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear. The input contains at most 107 parentheses.

Output

Output a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n such that concatenating the strings in this order results in a properly nested structure. If no such permutation exists, output "impossible."
