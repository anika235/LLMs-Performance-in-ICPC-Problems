Problem B
Curvy Little Bottles

Problem ID: bottle
In her travels, Jill finds bottles with interesting shapes, modeled by rotating polynomials around the x-axis. For a given polynomial P, x boundaries, and volume increment, calculate distances up from the base of the bottle for volume markings.

Input

Each test case contains:
1. Line 1: n, the degree of the polynomial.
2. Line 2: coefficients of the polynomial (a0 to an).
3. Line 3: xlow and xhigh, the bottle boundaries, and inc, the volume increment for markings.

Output

For each test case, display the case number, volume of the full bottle, and up to 8 distances for markings. Use "insufficient volume" if no marks are possible.

Sample input:
1
4.0 -0.25
0.0 12.0 25
