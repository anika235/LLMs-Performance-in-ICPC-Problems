Problem J
Shortest Flight Path

Problem ID: shortest
Given a maximum distance rule, calculate the shortest flight path between two airports while staying within the allowed range from the nearest airport. Refueling may be required at intermediate airports if necessary.

Input

Each test case has:
1. Two integers N (number of airports) and R (maximum distance allowed from the nearest airport).
2. N lines of airport coordinates (longitude, latitude).
3. An integer Q (number of queries), followed by Q queries each with integers s, t, and c (start, destination, and fuel capacity).

Output

For each query, display the shortest path distance accurate to three decimal places, or "impossible" if no path exists.

Sample input:
3 2000
0 0
0 30
30 0
3
2 3 5000
2 3 4000
2 3 3000
2 10000
45 45
225 -45
2
1 2 50000
2 1 50000

Sample output:
Case 1:
4724.686
6670.648
impossible
Case 2:
impossible
