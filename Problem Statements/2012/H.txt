Problem H
Room Service

Problem ID: room
In a convex polygonal room, a robot starts at a given point and needs to touch each wall of the room before returning to the starting point. Your task is to determine the shortest route that achieves this.

Input

Each test case starts with the number of vertices N of the polygon (3 ≤ N ≤ 100) and the coordinates of the robot's starting point. The next N lines provide the vertices of the polygon in counterclockwise order.

Output

For each test case, display the case number and the length of the shortest route to touch each wall and return to the start, accurate to two decimal places.

Sample input:
4 0 0
-1 -1
1 -1
1 1
-1 1
3 10 1
0 0
30 0
0 20

Sample output:
Case 1: 5.66
Case 2: 36.73
