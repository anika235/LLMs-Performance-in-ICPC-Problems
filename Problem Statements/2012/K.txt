Problem K
Stacking Plates

Problem ID: stacking
The Plate Shipping Company, an internet retailer specializing in plates, needs to pack plates into a single stack efficiently. Each manufacturer’s plates arrive as a single stack ordered by size. To combine these into one stack, you may perform two operations:
- Split: Separate a portion from the top of a stack to create a new stack.
- Join: Place one stack on top of another if the resulting stack remains ordered by size.

Input

Each test case begins with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), the number of stacks. Each of the next n lines describes a stack with:
- h, the number of plates in the stack, followed by
- h integers representing the diameters of the plates from top to bottom.

Output

For each test case, display the case number and the minimum number of operations (splits and joins) required to form a single ordered stack.

Sample input:
2
3 1 2 4
2 3 5
3
4 1 1 1 1
4 1 1 1 1
4 1 1 1 1

Sample output:
Case 1: 5
Case 2: 2
