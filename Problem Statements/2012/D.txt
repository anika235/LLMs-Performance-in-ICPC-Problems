Problem ID: fibonacci
The Fibonacci word sequence is defined as F(0) = "0", F(1) = "1", and F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n ≥ 2. Given a bit pattern p and a number n, count occurrences of p in F(n).

Input

Each test case has:
1. An integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 100),
2. A bit pattern p.

Output

Display the case number and the number of occurrences of p in F(n). Occurrences may overlap.
