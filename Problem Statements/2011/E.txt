Problem E
Coffee Central

Problem ID: coffee
You’re not sure if it's just a fad or here to stay, but the increasing number of coffee shops in your hometown has drawn attention from a real-estate company. They want to identify valuable locations based on proximity to coffee shops, as apartments near coffee shops fetch higher rents.

Input

The input contains several test cases. Each test case describes a city. The first line of each test case contains four integers dx, dy, n, and q:
- dx and dy are the dimensions of the city grid (1 ≤ dx, dy ≤ 1000),
- n is the number of coffee shops (0 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5),
- q is the number of queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 20).

Each of the next n lines contains two integers xi and yi, representing the location of the i-th coffee shop. Each of the next q lines contains a single integer m, representing the maximum distance a person is willing to walk for coffee.

The last test case is followed by a line containing four zeros.

Output

For each test case, display its case number. Then display one line per query in the test case. Each line displays the maximum number of coffee shops reachable within the query distance m from the optimal location, followed by the location in format (x, y). If there are multiple optimal locations, choose the location that is:
1. Furthest south (minimum y-coordinate),
2. Furthest west (minimum x-coordinate) if there's still a tie.
