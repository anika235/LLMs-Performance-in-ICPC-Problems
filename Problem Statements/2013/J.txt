Problem J
Pollution Solution

Time Limit: 1 second

As an employee of Aqueous Contaminate Management, you must monitor the pollution that gets dumped into rivers, lakes, and oceans. One of your jobs is to measure the impact of the pollution on various ecosystems in the water.

The model you use in your analysis is illustrated in Figure J.1. The shoreline lies on the x-axis with the source of the pollution located at the origin (0,0). The spread of the pollution into the water is represented by a semicircle, and the polygon represents the ecosystem of concern. You must determine the area of the ecosystem that is contaminated, represented by the dark blue region in the figure.

Input

The input consists of a single test case. A test case starts with a line containing two integers n and r, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 is the number of vertices in the polygon and 1 ≤ r ≤ 1 000 is the radius of the pollution field. This is followed by n lines, each containing two integers xi, yi, giving the coordinates of the polygon vertices in counter-clockwise order, where −1 500 ≤ xi ≤ 1 500 and 0 ≤ yi ≤ 1 500. The polygon does not self-intersect or touch itself. No vertex lies on the circle boundary.

Output

Display the area of the polygon that falls within the semicircle centered at the origin with radius r. Give the result with an absolute error of at most 10^−3.
