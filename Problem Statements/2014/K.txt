Problem K
Viral Advertising

Time Limit: 1 second

You have designed a new mobile app, and you plan to make it popular by using viral marketing. You
begin by sending the app to a few key people, who will spread it to other people, who will in turn spread
it to even more people, and so on.

You know that after you send out the initial set of invitations, every person who receives the app will
invite others to try it out. The number of new invitations each person sends out depends on how many
invitations they received initially. Specifically, each person who received k invitations will invite exactly
f (k) new people. The function f is defined as follows:

- f (k) = 0 if k is even.
- f (k) = k + 1 if k is odd.

Given this formula, write a program that calculates how many people will receive invitations after an
initial set of invitations.

Input

The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), the number of
people who initially receive invitations. Each of the next n lines contains a single integer k (1 ≤ k ≤
10^9), the number of invitations that each of the initial recipients received.

Output

Display a single integer, the total number of people who will receive invitations, including the initial
recipients.
