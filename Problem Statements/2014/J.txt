Problem J
Tunnels

Time Limit: 2 seconds

The Icelandic government has decided to build tunnels between different cities on the island. The cities
are represented as points on a 2D plane and the objective is to minimize the total length of tunnels built.
Unfortunately, the bedrock between some of the cities is fragile and does not allow for tunnels to be built
between them, which complicates the task.

Given a list of cities and the fragile connections, find the minimum total length of tunnels that can be
built to connect all cities, or determine that it is impossible to connect all cities.

Input

The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains two integers n and m, where n (1 ≤ n ≤
1 000) is the number of cities and m (0 ≤ m ≤ n(n − 1)/2) is the number of fragile connections. Cities
are numbered from 1 to n. The next n lines each contain two integers xi and yi (−10 000 ≤ xi, yi ≤
10 000), giving the coordinates
