Problem G
Metal Processing Plant

Time Limit: 4 seconds

Yulia works for a metal processing plant in Ekaterinburg. This plant processes ores mined in the
Ural mountains, extracting precious metals such as chalcopyrite, platinum and gold from the ores.
Every month the plant receives n shipments of unprocessed ore. Yulia needs to partition these ship-
ments into two groups based on their similarity. Then, each group is sent to one of two ore pro-
cessing buildings of the plant.

To perform this partitioning, Yulia first calculates a numeric distance d(i, j) for each pair of ship-
ments 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ n, where the smaller the distance, the more similar the shipments i and j
are. For a subset S ⊆ {1, . . . , n} of shipments, she then defines the disparity D of S as
the maximum distance between a pair of shipments in the subset, that is,

D(S) = max(i,j∈S) d(i, j).

Yulia then partitions the shipments into two subsets A and B in such a way that the sum of their dispar-
ities D(A) + D(B) is minimized. Your task is to help her find this partitioning.

Input

The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) indicating
the number of shipments. The following n− 1 lines contain the distances d(i, j). The ith of these lines
contains n − i integers and the jth integer of that line gives the value of d(i, i + j). The distances are
symmetric, so d(j, i) = d(i, j), and the distance of a shipment to itself is 0. All distances are integers
between 0 and 109 (inclusive).

Output

Display the minimum possible sum of disparities for partitioning the shipments into two groups.
