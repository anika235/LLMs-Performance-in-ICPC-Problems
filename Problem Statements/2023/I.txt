Problem I: Waterworld  
Time limit: 3 seconds  

Thousands of planets outside the Solar System have been discovered in recent years. An important factor for potential life support is the availability of liquid water. Detecting water on faraway planets is not easy. For rotating planets, a brand-new technology using relativistic quantum-polarized spectroscopy can help. It works as follows (this is a simplified description as only three people on this planet understand how it really works).  

Assume the telescope shows the planet such that its rotating axis is vertical and its equator is horizontal. Only the vertical line at the center of the image (the line that covers the rotating axis) is analyzed because it provides the highest resolution of the planet’s surface.  

The analysis proceeds in steps of d degrees. In one step, data is aggregated while the planet rotates by d degrees, so each step gives information about a slice of d degrees of the planet’s surface. The image is split into n segments of equal height, which are analyzed separately. So the slice of d degrees is partitioned into n areas A1, . . . , An. For each area Ai, image analysis produces a number that gives the percentage of Ai covered by water.  

The above process is repeated for the next d degrees of rotation, and so on, a total number of m times, until the whole surface of the planet has been covered (that is, md = 360 degrees). Your task is to compute the percentage of the planet’s surface covered by water from the given data.  

Input  
The first line of input contains the two integers n and m (2 ≤ n,m ≤ 1000). Each of the following n lines contains m integers ai,j (0 ≤ ai,j ≤ 100 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ m). Each column of this matrix describes the measurements for a single step, that is, a rotation by d degrees. The number ai,j is the percentage of area Ai that is covered by water in the jth step.  

Output  
Output the percentage of the planet’s surface covered by water. Your answer should have an absolute error of at most 10−6.
