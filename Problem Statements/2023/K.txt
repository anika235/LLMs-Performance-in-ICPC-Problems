Problem K: Alea Iacta Est  
Time limit: 10 seconds  

You play a game with multiple fair six-sided dice. Each die’s face displays a single symbol. The objective of the game is to roll the dice and create a valid word from the symbols on top of each die. If you cannot form a word, you may reroll the dice for another attempt.  

When you roll a die, it lands on any one of its faces with equal probability. What is the expected number of rolls needed to make a valid word, assuming you use an optimal strategy?  

Input  
The first line of input contains two numbers d and w, where d (1 ≤ d ≤ 6) is the number of dice and w (1 ≤ w ≤ 2 · 105) is the number of valid words in the dictionary. The following d lines each have 6 symbols, one for each face of the die. The final w lines contain w distinct valid words in the dictionary. Every word has exactly d symbols.  

All symbols in the input are either uppercase letters (A–Z) or digits (0–9).  

Output  
If it is possible to make a valid word, output the expected number of rolls needed to make a valid word when using an optimal strategy. Otherwise, output impossible. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most 10−6.
